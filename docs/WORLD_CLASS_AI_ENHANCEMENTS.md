## 1. Real-Time Profile Preview

### Purpose
Show users their emerging profile in real-time as they answer questions. Creates transparency, builds trust, and encourages detailed responses.

### Implementation

**Files Created:**
- `components/ui/live-profile-preview.tsx` - Visual component
- `lib/ai-onboarding/live-profile-extractor.ts` - Client-side extraction logic

**Key Features:**
- **5 Profile Sections:**
  1. Skin Type (oily, dry, combination, sensitive)
  2. Main Concerns (acne, aging, hyperpigmentation, pores, etc.)
  3. Current Routine (products and frequency)
  4. Lifestyle Context (stress, sleep, exercise, outdoor exposure)
  5. Skincare Goals (clear skin, anti-aging, hydration, etc.)

- **Confidence Indicators:**
  - Visual 5-dot scale (filled = high confidence)
  - Color-coded: Emerald (0.8+), Amber (0.6-0.8), Orange (0.4-0.6), Slate (<0.4)
  - Text labels: "Clear understanding", "Getting there", "Learning more", "Still exploring"

- **Real-Time Updates:**
  - Extracts keywords from user messages
  - Updates confidence based on detail and frequency
  - Shows insights as badge tags (e.g., "Oily T-zone", "Seasonal dryness")

- **Smart Visibility:**
  - Appears after 2+ messages
  - Hides when profile is complete
  - Encouragement tip when overall confidence < 70%

## 2. Conversation Memory & Context Awareness

### Purpose
AI remembers and naturally references earlier statements, creating continuity and making users feel truly heard.

### Implementation

**File Created:**
- `lib/ai-onboarding/conversation-memory.ts`

**How It Works:**

1. **Fact Extraction:**
   - Scans all user messages for key information
   - Categorizes into topics: Skin Type, Concerns, Patterns, Routine, Lifestyle, Preferences
   - Assigns confidence levels: High, Medium, Low
   - Stores message index for reference

2. **Context Building:**
   ```typescript
   CONVERSATION MEMORY (Reference naturally):

   Skin Type:
     - They mentioned having oily/shiny skin
     - They have combination skin with oily T-zone

   Concerns:
     - They deal with acne/breakouts
     - They mentioned pore concerns

   Patterns:
     - They mentioned skin changes during midday
     - They mentioned seasonal skin changes

   Routine:
     - They use a cleanser
     - They use SPF/sunscreen

   Lifestyle:
     - They experience stress/anxiety
     - They spend time outdoors

   USER ENGAGEMENT:
   - User is highly engaged, giving detailed responses
   - Feel free to dive deeper and ask follow-up questions

   RECENT TOPICS (for natural transitions):
     - routine
     - concerns
   ```

3. **Natural References:**
   - AI receives memory context with every new message
   - Enables responses like:
     - "Earlier you mentioned your skin gets oily by midday - does that happen more in summer or year-round?"
     - "You said you use SPF - that's great! How about at night, what's your evening routine?"
     - "I remember you mentioned stress - have you noticed your skin acting differently during high-stress periods?"

### Fact Categories

**Skin Type Facts (High Confidence):**
- Oily/greasy/shiny skin
- Dry/tight/flaky skin
- T-zone/combination
- Sensitive/reactive skin

**Concern Facts (High Confidence):**
- Acne/breakouts/pimples
- Wrinkles/fine lines/aging
- Dark spots/hyperpigmentation
- Pores/blackheads

**Pattern Facts (Medium Confidence):**
- Timing patterns (morning/evening/midday)
- Seasonal patterns (winter/summer)

**Routine Facts (High Confidence):**
- Products mentioned (cleanser, moisturizer, serum, etc.)
- Active ingredients (retinol, vitamin C, AHA/BHA)
- Minimal/no routine

**Lifestyle Facts (Medium-High Confidence):**
- Stress/anxiety
- Sleep patterns
- Exercise/activity
- Outdoor exposure

**Preference Facts (Medium-High Confidence):**
- Budget concerns
- Fragrance-free preference

### Benefits
- **Continuity:** Conversation flows naturally, not like interrogation
- **Personalization:** AI adapts to what it already knows
- **Efficiency:** Avoids asking redundant questions
- **Connection:** Users feel heard and understood
- **Intelligence:** AI appears genuinely interested and attentive

---

## 3. Adaptive Question Depth

### Purpose
Detect user engagement level and adapt questioning style accordingly. Engaged users get deep dive, brief responders get simple questions with examples.

### Implementation

**File Created:**
- `lib/ai-onboarding/adaptive-questioning.ts`

**Engagement Analysis:**

```typescript
Metrics:
- Average message length (characters)
- Average word count
- Percentage of detailed responses (20+ words)
- Percentage of brief responses (<5 words)

Thresholds:
- High Engagement: 120+ chars, 20+ words, 50%+ detailed
- Low Engagement: <40 chars, <8 words, 50%+ brief
- Medium Engagement: Everything in between
```

### Adaptive Strategies

**For HIGH Engagement Users:**
```
ADAPTIVE QUESTIONING GUIDANCE:

User Engagement Level: HIGH

Recommended Approach:
  User is highly engaged. Dive deep with follow-up questions.
  Explore nuances and patterns they mention. You can ask 2-3
  related questions in sequence.

DIVE DEEPER:
  - User is engaged and provides detail
  - Ask thoughtful follow-up questions
  - Explore nuances and patterns they mention

Example Questions for This User:
  - "That's really interesting - can you tell me more about what that feels like?"
  - "You mentioned X earlier - how does that connect with what you just shared?"
  - "I'm curious about the timing - does this happen more in certain situations?"
```

**For MEDIUM Engagement Users:**
```
ADAPTIVE QUESTIONING GUIDANCE:

User Engagement Level: MEDIUM

Recommended Approach:
  User provides moderate detail. Keep questions clear and focused.
  Gently encourage elaboration when needed, but don't overwhelm.

Example Questions for This User:
  - "Could you tell me a bit more about that?"
  - "What does that look like for your skin day-to-day?"
  - "How long have you noticed this pattern?"
```

**For LOW Engagement Users:**
```
ADAPTIVE QUESTIONING GUIDANCE:

User Engagement Level: LOW

Recommended Approach:
  User gives brief responses. Keep questions SIMPLE and SPECIFIC.
  Ask one thing at a time. Always provide concrete examples to
  help them respond.

PROVIDE EXAMPLES:
  - User tends to give brief responses
  - Include specific examples to help them respond
  - "For example: oily by midday, dry in winter, combination..."

Example Questions for This User:
  - "How does your skin feel by the end of the day? (For example: oily, tight, normal)"
  - "Do you use any skincare products right now? (Like cleanser, moisturizer, sunscreen)"
  - "What bothers you most about your skin? (For example: breakouts, dryness, oiliness)"
```

### Real-World Adaptation

**Scenario 1: Engaged User**
```
User: "My skin is definitely combination - I have an oily T-zone that gets really
       shiny by midday, especially in summer, but my cheeks can feel tight and dry,
       particularly in winter months. It's frustrating because I don't know if I should
       treat it as oily or dry!"

AI Detected: HIGH engagement (108 words, detailed description)

AI Response: "I hear you - that midday shine can be so frustrating! Since you mentioned
              it's worse in summer, I'm curious - when your T-zone gets oily, do you
              notice any breakouts in that area? And for your dry cheeks in winter,
              does the skin ever feel flaky or just tight?"
```

**Scenario 2: Brief Responder**
```
User: "oily"
User: "yeah"
User: "sometimes"

AI Detected: LOW engagement (1-2 words per response)

AI Response: "Got it! Let me ask this in a simpler way. When does your skin feel most
              oily - is it right when you wake up, by lunchtime, or by the end of the day?

              For example:
              - Oily all day
              - Gets oily by midday
              - Only oily in the morning"
```

### Benefits
- **Personalized Pacing:** Fast for engaged users, simple for brief responders
- **Better Data Quality:** Users provide more useful information
- **Reduced Friction:** Brief responders don't feel overwhelmed
- **Higher Completion:** Adapts to user's natural communication style
- **Respectful:** Matches user's effort level

## User Experience Flow

### Example: Engaged User Journey

**Message 1:**
```
User: "My main frustration is that my skin gets super oily by midday,
       especially in my T-zone, and then I get breakouts. It's been
       happening for about 2 years now."
```

**AI Response:**
```
I hear you - that midday shine can be so frustrating! And dealing with
breakouts on top of that must be tough. You mentioned it's been about
2 years - I'm curious, did anything change in your life around that
time? Like stress levels, new job, or changes to your routine?

[Live Profile Preview appears]:
✨ Your Profile - 35% complete
- Skin Type: Combination with oily T-zone ●●●●○
- Concerns: Acne & Breakouts, Oily skin ●●●●○
- Patterns: Midday oiliness ●●●○○
```

**Message 2:**
```
User: "Actually yes! I started a new job 2 years ago and it's been
       pretty stressful. I also started using a heavier moisturizer
       around that time because I thought my skin was dehydrated."
```

**AI Response (with Memory):**
```
That's really helpful to know - stress can definitely impact skin, and
the timing matches perfectly. About that heavier moisturizer you mentioned -
since you have an oily T-zone, it might be too much for that area even if
your cheeks need it.

Do you use the same products all over your face, or do you treat your
T-zone differently than your cheeks?

[Live Profile Preview updates]:
✨ Your Profile - 52% complete
- Skin Type: Combination (oily T-zone) ●●●●●
- Concerns: Acne, Oiliness ●●●●●
- Routine: Heavy moisturizer (all over) ●●●○○
- Lifestyle: High stress, new job ●●●●○
- Patterns: Started 2 years ago ●●●●○
```

**Message 3:**
```
User: "Same products everywhere. I use CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser and
       their Moisturizing Cream morning and night. Should I be doing
       something different?"
```

**AI Response (with Memory + Adaptive):**
```
Great question! So you're using CeraVe's Hydrating line - that's a good
gentle cleanser. But earlier you mentioned your T-zone gets oily by midday
and you're breaking out there. That Moisturizing Cream is pretty rich, which
is perfect for dry areas but might be clogging your oily T-zone.

Here's what I'm thinking - have you ever tried using different products
on different parts of your face? Like a lighter gel moisturizer just on
your T-zone, and keeping the cream for your cheeks?

[Live Profile Preview updates]:
✨ Your Profile - 68% complete
- Skin Type: Combination (oily T-zone, drier cheeks) ●●●●●
- Concerns: Acne in T-zone, Oiliness ●●●●●
- Routine: CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser (AM/PM), CeraVe Cream (AM/PM) ●●●●●
- Lifestyle: High stress (2 years) ●●●●○
- Patterns: Midday oiliness, breakouts in T-zone ●●●●●
```

### Example: Brief Responder Journey

**Message 1:**
```
User: "oily skin"
```

**AI Response (Adaptive - Provides Examples):**
```
Got it - oily skin can be frustrating! Let me ask this simply:

When is your skin most oily? For example:
- Oily all day long
- Gets oily by midday
- Only oily in certain areas (like forehead or nose)

[Live Profile Preview appears]:
✨ Your Profile - 18% complete
- Skin Type: Oily ●●●○○
💡 Tip: The more details you share, the more personalized
         your recommendations will be!
```

**Message 2:**
```
User: "midday"
```

**AI Response (Adaptive - Simple, One Question):**
```
Perfect, that helps!

Do you get breakouts with the oiliness? Just yes or no is fine.

[Live Profile Preview updates]:
✨ Your Profile - 28% complete
- Skin Type: Oily ●●●●○
- Patterns: Midday oiliness ●●●○○
```

**Message 3:**
```
User: "yes sometimes"
```

**AI Response (Adaptive - Specific Options):**
```
Okay! One more quick question:

What skincare products do you use right now? Pick the ones that apply:
- Cleanser (face wash)
- Moisturizer (lotion or cream)
- Sunscreen or SPF
- Nothing / very minimal

[Live Profile Preview updates]:
✨ Your Profile - 42% complete
- Skin Type: Oily ●●●●●
- Concerns: Occasional breakouts ●●●○○
- Patterns: Midday oiliness ●●●●○
